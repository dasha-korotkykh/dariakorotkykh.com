— Heads up!
Given repository consists of content, assets and a year-long story of my personal résumé hosted currently at  dariakorotkykh.com.

I started it <em>as a study for Binary Studio Academy lesson in GitHub</em> with simple html document and basic styles, based on already developed personal webpage by Volodymyr Kushnir, and continued prettyfying and refactoring with his help, guidance and urging <sup>(thanks, Volodya!)</sup>.
In a year he developed his own (stylesheet available for use)[https://github.com/volodymyr-kushnir/volodymyrkushnir.com/tree/master/assets/stylesheets], which I employ at my webpage too (with some custom changes, so there's almost no former CSS code left). And does it feel and look good! (:

Currently the main purpose of this page is to tell about myself in a readable and aesthetic way. I use it as a résumé accompanied with cover letter when applying for a job, and update it to keep my own curriculum vitae track of things and events. 
To do so I break down all the info in categories:

* Contacts
How to get in touch. Telegram is preferable by all means!

* Intro
Short summary of one's self-presentation

* Experience & Education
All important professinal events, jobs and projects from the most recent back to those oldest, e-e-e-e-every one — becuse together they form personality and skill portrait, and tell good stories also. I skipped the earliest, childhood ones for now.

* Languages
Hope to add more in that block later

* Skills
It is always hard to decide whether list them like items or describe more of actions. For the sake of clarity I took the best on both approaches

* Character
Hey, it is the best option to imagine that persone who wrote it without actually having to meet (: Anyway, while that block was being born I accidentally learned a lot about how other people perceive me

* Likes & Dislikes
Second most unexpected block on one's CV, on the other hand great opportunity to discover something in common <em>(hate for facebook, mmmmmm)</em>. 

* Wants
The Most Unexpected block, suggested by my abovementioned mentor, I fill with goals I am really interested in. Guess it also kinda falls into personality description. Fun fact, since writing it in December <em>(approximately)</em> two goals have already been removed due to reaching. I am definitely keeping that part of CV as my both self-made motivator and promise.
